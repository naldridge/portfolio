				<h1>Nick Aldridge - Jr. Developer</h1>
				<p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer student in the DigitalCrafts bootcamp based in Houston, TX. I'm
					currently looking for remote positions that utilize my skills, as well as helps me to grow in the
					development community. I have experience putting together full-stack projects with the PERN stack
					along with some Python, VBA, and analytical skills</p>

				<p>On a personal note, I'm a fan of the Houston Astros, Star Wars, and any reason I can find to spend time outdoors. Serving in the Air Force allowed me the opportunity to travel and see more cultures than I could have imagined and it has left a lasting impression and desire to share those experiences. I also have a passion for animal advocacy and working with the community to improve our understanding of our impacts on the environment.</p>
